# CD4052-EXPANSION-BOARD

Expansion board for  CD4052, dual 4-channel analog multiplexer/demultiplexer integrated circuit (IC)

Uses two binary control inputs (A and B) and a digital inhibit (INH) input to select the active channel. A low logic level on the INH pin enables the channels, while a high level disables all channels.

With arduino code, you can switch between channels to read sensor data or other data sources
